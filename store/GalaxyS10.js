    "Samsung's 2019 flagship is widely considered the best phone for everyone, due to it's versatility in software and hardware features. One of the first smartphones to introduce the ultra sonic in-screen fingerprint scanner; making for a secure biometric feature. In addition the S10+ sports a triple camera system, one for ultra-wide shots, the second for regular shots, and the last for 2x zoom in shots. The Galaxy S10+ was also the first device to sports Samsung's nes dynamic amoled HDR10+ display, providing rich punchy colors and the perfect sharpness for viewing videos and other content. Gaming is something you'll never have to worry about ethier as it comes with the Snapdragon 855 and 8GB of ram with plenty of storage. Battery life isn't a problem either as the 4100 mAh battery should last you all day, and you can juice it up to 80% in just an hour. Since the S20 has came the price has dropped for the base model to $699 making it a steal. There have even been reports of the battery lasting up to two days on a single charge.",
