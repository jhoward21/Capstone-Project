Usually the hype around the Pixel series is it's camera, but this time Google has added a 90hz display panel to increase the smoothness of the software flow. Although thats nice it's ok sized 3700 mAh battery won't do it much justice with a higher refresh rate. Google has sent out updates which have improved its battery life. Something has been present on other phones, but is new to Pixel is dual rear facing cameras. With it's telephoto lens you'll have 2x optical zoom for clearer zoomed in shots.
