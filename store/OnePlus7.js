  info:
    "OnePlus's spring 'flagship killer' a is must buy considering what it offers for it's price range is unbeatable for most. You can most likely find this device priced in a ranged of $500-$700 which is in the mid to high range for phone prices. One of the OnePlus 7 Pro's key features includes it's 90hz screen refresh rate at a high resolution with HDR10+ included. You can definitely notice the difference between 60hz and 90hz when playing games such as Call Of Duty Mobile, but is behind newer 2020 phones such as it's successor the OnePlus 8 and Samsung's Galaxy S20 with their 120hz display. Another thing you'll enjoy is it's slick and smooth software that's named Oxygen OS, but still runs Android 10. Oxygen is basically Samsung and Google's software mixed together, but better looking then both. Providing the features of Samsung while providing the responsiveness and smoothness of stock Android. Another thing you'd might enjoy is its near bezel less display. OnePlus nearly achieved this by adding a pop-up camera instead of the notch or punch-hole most companies use. Once you open the camera up it instantly pop-up in less than a second.",
