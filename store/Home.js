    "'There aren’t many phones out there, from Samsung or other OEMs, that use “Ultra” in their names. It seems Samsung realized that it would have to do justice to this word if it decided to call the top-of-the-line 2020 flagship the Galaxy S20 Ultra. It became clear on the day Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S20 series that it meant business with the Ultra. Samsung can pump out respectable flagship smartphones that hold their own against competitors every year without breaking a sweat. Being good enough wasn’t the objective of the Ultra. Samsung wanted to make something that would truly wow both its fans and its detractors. So it threw everything and the kitchen sink at the Galaxy S20 Ultra.

    "'One of the most refined aspects of the P40 Pro is its design — though not in the way you might think. See, the P40 Pro has raised corners with glass that’s curved on all four sides to mimic water on the brink of breaking surface tension. This results in a unique aesthetic that won’t be to everyone’s taste — certainly not mine. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but the ultra-thin bezels just look odd, especially head-on. However, the design’s byproduct is fantastic ergonomic improvements. For example, swipe gestures have become the default way to navigate our phones. Some devices struggle to make the gestures feel seamless due to the harsh transition from metal to glass, particularly the top and bottom edges. With the P40 Pro’s curved glass, swiping in from any direction feels smoother than anything I’ve ever used...' (Source: Full Review on AndroidAuthority.) Written By Ryan-Thomas Shaw. ",
